			<h1>1.0.2 <em>(2010-10-16)</em></h1>

		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h1>1.0.1 <em>(2010-10-15)</em></h1>
			<h2>Bug Fixes:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Revert a force close catcher since it can cause an infinite game restart loop leading to a force close itself. Remember, please click "Report" on any force closes if you are on Android 2.2 or newer.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h1>1.0.0 <em>(2010-10-13)</em></h1>
			<h2>Bug Fixes:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Fail gracefully when background image is no longer available.</li>

			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div>

			<h2>New Features:</h2>

				<li>New RGB color picker which allows for any color to be easily selected.</li>
				<li>Specify widget locations to customize the grid layout to not go behind your widgets. See "Widget Locations" under "Display" settings.</li>
				<li>Opacity can now be set on background images.</li>
				<li>Initial top and bottom padding is based off of device independent pixels (DIPs). This should allow the grid to be properly aligned out-of-the-box 99% of the time.</li>
				<li>HUD size is now a user-configurable option and will default to an appropriate size for the display.</li>
				<li>Board will rotate and resize with device orientation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Bug Fixes:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Color and number preferences now only save when you click "OK" rather than when the value was changed.</li>

			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h1>1.0.0 RC5 <em>(2010-08-12)</em></h1>

			</ul>
			<h2>Bug Fixes:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Fix the 1.0x10^100 trophy to trigger regardless of whether or not a life has been lost.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h1>1.0.0 RC4 <em>(2010-08-09)</em></h1>
			<h2>New Features:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Trophies</strong>! There are four trophies which unlock special variations on the game. Check out the "Trophies" screen to see the achievements required to unlock each.</em></li>
			</ul>

			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h1>1.0.0 RC3 <em>(2010-08-06)</em></h1>
			<h2>New Features:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Edge wrapping for entities. Optionally allow The Man and/or ghosts to wrap around all edges or just the middle row.</li>
				<li>New "Around The Web" section of "About" containing links to official web sites related to Wakka Wallpaper.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Bug Fixes:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Draw the entirety of the ghost body path as we can't rely on it automatically linking the final two segments when the entities style is stroke.</li>
				<li>When the entity style is set to stroke ensure the warning blink when frightened is also drawn in that style.</li>
				<li>The lives of The Man should be drawn in the same style as the player entity.</li>
				<li>Always paint the background color every frame regardless of whether an image has been set or not. This ensures that the screen will be cleared when you are using background images with transparency.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div>

			<h2>New Features:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Increased row and column maximum to 8 to match ADW.Launcher maximums.</li>
				<li>Add ability to draw walls around icons to match the iOS static wallpaper (<em>thanks <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=741957#post7482447">chazam</a>!</em>). Due to the slight but deliberate misalignment of the grid by default as a tradeoff between edge visibility and icon alignment, the walls will not perfectly surround your icons. You can adjust the "Grid Padding" settings under "Display" to tweak the alignment to your liking.</li>   
			</ul>
			<h2>Bug Fixes:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Importing of old or partial JSONs will no longer cause a force close.</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>1.0.0 beta 3 <em>(2010-07-25)</em></h1>
			<h2>New Features:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Tapping the top, bottom, left, or right of your screen will influence The Man's direction. If you tap a direction, he will attempt to change to that direction every time he moves until he hits a wall. If he successfully changes direction he will continue going that direction until he hits a wall. If he hit a wall while going the current direction and was unable to change to your desired direction the AI will choose a new direction and your desired direction will be cleared. This does not yet work in landscape. The directions are calculated based off of the center of your screen and not The Man's location. Even though you may be tapping to The Man's left, if it is to the right of the screen center he will go right.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Bug Fixes:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Ghosts, The Man, Fruit, and "Ready"/"Game Over" text now rotate when in landscape.</li>
