		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		<h2>Introductory Video</h2>
		<p>You can view an <a href="http://youtu.be/sVA40a1qXCs">introductory video on YouTube</a> that gives a quick overview of the features of this live wallpaper.</p>
		
		<h2>Display Settings</h2>
		<p>The layout of the grid has been optimized by default for WVGA devices (800x480, 854x480, etc.). If you are using a HVGA device (480x320) the grid might not line up with your icons by default.</p>
		<p>You can adjust the location of the grid by changing the top and bottom padding in the settings. Once in the settings, go to the "Display" category and then click the "Grid Padding" option. From here you can tweak the top and bottom padding (the offset from the edge of the screen) to your liking. Try starting with a top value of 25 and a bottom value of 50 and then adjusting to your liking.</p>
		<p>If you are using a launcher other than the default one (ADW.Launcher, Launcher Pro, etc.) and have changed the number of icon rows and columns you will need to change that setting in the wallpaper too. They are located under "Display" as "Icon Rows" and "Icon Columns" settings.</p>
		<p>Users of HTC devices with Sense will needs to adjust the "HUD Offset" option under "Display" to a higher value so that you can see the number of lives and score.</p>
		
		<h2>Game Settings</h2>
		<p>The gameplay of the wallpaper is full customizable under the "Game" category. From here you can customize nearly every aspect of the game to your liking.</p>
		<p>If you prefer continual action, try changing the game mode to "Endless" and uncheck the "Deadly" option under the "Ghosts" section.</p>
		<p>The "User Control" setting, when enabled, allow you to touch to the top, bottom, left, and right of the screen center to influence The Man's movements. Remember, these directions are calculated from the center of the screen and NOT from The Man's current position.</p> 
		
		<h2>Color Settings</h2>
		<p>Along with changing gameplay, you can customize nearly every color of the wallpaper to your liking. By default the colors have been styled to match a static wallpaper that was floating around for the iPhone in June of 2010.</p>
		<p>Create your own color scheme to match your phone theme or favorite colors. If you aren't ready to fully give up a picture wallpaper you can even have a static image as the background by choosing "Background Image" under "Game Board" in the "Color" category.</p>
		
		<h2>Trophies</h2>
		<p>Unlike most live wallpapers, Wakka Wallpaper features unlockable trophies just like a full game. These trophies offer enhancements to the gameplay or display.</p>
		<p>The list of trophies is available under the "Trophies" category in the settings. Each one will display a hint as to how you can unlock it. Once unlocked, the hint will disappear and a small quip will be displayed that should clue you in to what it will change. You can enabled any number of trophies by checking their entry. Some trophies will disable other trophies as they both affect the same feature (e.g., "Brand Identity" and "What's For Dessert?").</p>
		
		<h2>Settings Import/Export</h2>
		<p>If you want to save or share your color Wakka Wallpaper configuration click the menu button on the main settings screen and choose "Export". This will write a file to your SD card that contains all of your settings.</p>
		<p>Choosing "Import" from the menu will allow you to pull in your backed up settings or ones from someone else. Remember, <strong>importing settings will overwrite any customizations you have made</strong>!<p>
		
		<h2>Reset</h2>
		<p>If at any time you totally screw up your settings and just want to return them to their defaults, each main category contains a reset option at the bottom of the screen. This will only reset the settings related to that category.</p>
		<p>If you want to reset all of the wallpaper settings to default then there is a "Reset" option in the menu on the main settings screen. This will reset every setting back to its initial state.</p>

		<h2>Bugs? Force closes?</h2>
		<p>ALWAYS report bugs and force closes to <a href="mailto:jakewharton@gmail.com">jakewharton@gmail.com</a>. There are a lot of devices and thousands of settings combinations which I probably have not had the opportunity to test and your feedback will help improve the wallpaper. Emails are infinitely more helpful than negative feedback on the Market.</p>
		<p>Questions, comments, and suggestions are also always welcome too!</p>
